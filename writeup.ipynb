    "# Feature Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to classify images as _cars_ and _non-cars_ a classifier needs to be created. Two approaches are explored in this project: using a convolutional neural network, and using a classifier trained on extracted features. The features used to train the classifier are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spatial Features\n",
    "* Colour Histogram Features\n",
    "* Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial features are the raw pixel values of the images flattened into a vector. This operation can be performed on different solor spaces. IN this project, both the HLS and the RGB colour spaces are used to generate spatial features. An example is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![spatial-features](./report_images/spatial.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Colour Histogram Features\n",
    "\n",
    "A histogram of the color values in an image can be very telling. For example, a saturated red is a colour not typically found in nature, however, there are many cars that are painted this colour. A histogram of each image is taken in the RGB and HLS colour spaces and the values are used as features for the classifier. An example histogram for the above image is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![colour-histogram](./report_images/histogram-features.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) Features\n",
    "\n",
    "A Histogram of Oriented Gradients was also used to extract features from the images. The way it works, is gradients of the pixel values in the images are first taken. The direction of the gradients is then determined, and a histogram of those directions are produced. In this way, a signature set of features can be produced for images of different objects. An example is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hog Features](report_images/hog.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell in the HOG features contains 12x12 = 144 pixels. Each of the gradients are slotted into 8 different directional bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "As the spatial, color histogram, and HOG features are all on different scales, it is important to perform feature normalization to ensure the classifier does not learn to recognize a certain feature as being more important than others based on its scale. More on this can be found in this [example that I wrote for Sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_scaling_importance.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-preprocessing-plot-scaling-importance-py). Normalization is done using the `StandardScaler()` class from Sklearn. The result of the normalization is shown below:\n",

    "# Training a classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "A few different classifiers are examined for this project. A LinearSVC from Sklearn is a great candidated becuase it is fast, and [used typically in pedestrian detection](https://rodrigob.github.io/documents/2014_eccvw_ten_years_of_pedestrian_detection_with_supplementary_material.pdf). Also examined are RandomForest and Adaboost algorithms, as boosting algorithms perform very well in feature based classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting a performance metric\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance metric used in this binary classification problem (car or non-car) is _recall_. The training data used for the classifier is, for the most part, balanced, however it is anticipated that in the testing environment there will be far more _non-car_ images tested. Furthermore, filtering using a heatmap (explained in a later section) is going to take place, so precision are not a major concern. Therefore having a classifier that can correctly identify a car every time is more critical.\n",

This highlights a need to work more on the machine learning based image detection algorithm. A tempting candidate is a convolutional neural network, however the initial investigation into using CNNs did not yield better results than the RandomForest classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is evident that the very high validation results (_~98.8%_) and lower test results from all of the false positives in the video means that the classifier is overfitting drastically. One method for overcoming this would be to obtain more data and perform data augmentation. A properly designed CNN with lots of data, data augmentation, and using dropout and regularization would be considered to be idea, however this is out of the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the results obtained can be further improved using more parameter tuning. As I am doing this project on an old Macbook Pro (cerca 2009), it was frustratingly slow to iterate through different parameter selections.\n",
